Take one of your items from Responsive Media Streaming and create detailed item page. It should be a single page and any navigation
should use anchors (id).
Use the following images for your basic layout:
• Mobile
• Desktop
• CSS Grid for Desktop
• An example of the site
• The sections to use flexbox
Consider this a task list:


• Start with your template
• Use a CSS reset loaded from a CDN
• All your CSS must be in an external stylesheet loaded with a relative path
• Mobile first design, breakpoint = 650px


• All javascript must be in an external file loaded with a relative path
- Header with logo and nav
• Should be styled differently on mobile, use javascript to show/hide the nav
- Hero
• Large image of the item
• When user hovers over this image use css transform scale(1.5) to make the image zoom
• Keep the hero section the same size and don’t let the image go over (overflow hidden)
- Main Content
• No matter how much content is in this section the bottom of Sidebar and Extra Content should always line up
• I will be adding/removing content to check
- Sidebar
• An unordered list WITHOUT bullets
- Extra Content


• Use flexbox to layout 3 blocks of content
• I will be adding/removing extra content
• There should always be 3 blocks on content on a row, no matter the size of the browser window
- Related Images
• Use flexbox to layout images
• I will be adding/removing images


• When user hovers over images use css transform scale(1.2) to make the image zoom
• Keep the image container the same size and don’t let the image go over (overflow hidden)
• On desktop (>=650px), images should be 150px wide. As the browser window gets bigger there will be more images in a row
• On mobile (<650px), there should be 2 images in a row
- Related Posts
- • An unordered list WITH bullets
- Footer
• Includes contact info (site name, email), accessible contact form and a link to scroll to the top
• Footer contact form













fieldset and legend tags
• required ‘your name’ text field, required ‘your email’ email field, required ‘your message’ textarea
• if you have labels for your fields (instead of only having placeholders) make sure they’re accessible (label for = field id)
• visual indicator of required fields besides relying on colour cues
-General good programing practices
- images should have short, meaningful alt attributes
- there should never be a horizontal scroll bar
- NO NOT USE CSS FLOAT
• Final requirements based on marking a previous assignment
• no jquery
• no extra libraries
• use event listeners (not element onclick)
• link to top should be anchor (not js)
